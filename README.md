# Durbar - A student centric ride sharing website.

### Developed by Sumit Sen ([@SumitSenBD](http://www.github.com/SumitSenBD)) 

**Durbar** is a ride sharing website designed specifically for students. 
The solution initially stemmed from the inadequate number of parking spaces available within campus and the aim to reduce traffic congestion within the area.
